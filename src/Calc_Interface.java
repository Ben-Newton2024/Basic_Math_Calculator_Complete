         Follow BIDMAS

         This however cannot be the most efficient version of this, as this assumes there is going to be
         one of each operator within the calculation
         as such it will go through the list looping multiple times, till the equation is sorted
         some checks could be added in the future, showing what operators are involved with the equation,
         to only need to loop through the list the minimum amount of times. rather doing the max
         amount of times per equation which will waste 'time' and space.
         This could be done via if statements and boolean values that loops the entire equation once,
         that changes values from false to true if an operator is detected.
         as such later here, the ifs can catch if an only the '+' operator is detected as such skip any unneeded loops
         from the indices and decision etc., to only need to loop the once at the addition.
