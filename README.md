This is to practice using GitHub, and also use build the basis for a calculator project.

Using this repository and Project to lean Github, and managing a simple project via intellij through the github projects tab.

Basic Java calculator that runs from console, you input basic equation like 2+4-1*4 etc, and should output onto the next line

Not the most efficient, however i am happy with its current stage, and consider it mostly complete, will come back to tinker with it gradually. 
this is to also test, that the code is understandable when comming back to the projected after a couple of weeks.
